# Speaker-Verification

In this project, we trained recurrent neural networks with our voice hoping it would be able to identify the speaker correct.

The detail of our approach and the model can be found here [Project Report](https://github.com/Jacob-Yage-Jin/Speaker-Verification/blob/main/Project_Report.pdf).
